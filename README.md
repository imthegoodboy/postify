# Postify - Decentralized Blog Platform on Filecoin

![Postify Logo](public/favicon.ico)

## üåü What is Postify?

Postify is a revolutionary decentralized blog platform that puts you in complete control of your content. Unlike traditional blogging platforms where your content can be censored or deleted, Postify uses the power of the Filecoin network to ensure your blog is truly yours forever.

Think of it as your personal corner of the internet that no one can take away from you. Whether you're a writer, artist, developer, or just someone with stories to share, Postify gives you the tools to create a beautiful blog that's stored on the decentralized web.

## üöÄ Why We Built This

We believe the internet should be free, open, and censorship-resistant. Traditional platforms can delete your content, change their rules, or even shut down entirely. With Postify, your content lives on the Filecoin network - a decentralized storage system that's impossible to censor or shut down.

When you publish on Postify, you're not just creating a blog post, you're contributing to a more free and open internet.
